🌀 Stepper Motor Control with Verilog | Altera Cyclone IV (DE1-115 Board)
This project demonstrates a basic stepper motor controller implemented in Verilog HDL, targeting the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA on the DE1-115 development board. The design allows directional control of a standard bipolar stepper motor.

🔧 Features
✅ Full-step drive mode
🔄 Direction control (CW / CCW)
🖥️ Simple switch-based input interface
💡 LED indicators for motor stepping activity

⚙️ Hardware Setup
🧩 FPGA: Altera Cyclone IV (DE1-115 board)
⚙️ Stepper Motor: NEMA17 & DRV8825 Driver
🎛️ Inputs: Board switches for direction and step control
🔌 Output: GPIO pins connected to stepper driver inputs
